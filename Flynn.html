        <p>Background: Flynn(Eugene) never knew his parents and spent most of the time in the orphanage. He told the other orphans tales of 'The Tales of Flynnigan Rider' a rich and dashing swashbuckler. Once he left the orphanage when he was older, he went by the alias Flynn Rider.</p>
        <p>Personality: To begin with, he's arrogant, backstabbing and a trouble-maker. Although his arrogance is more of a defence mechanism and it provides a false sense of optimism when in reality he's vunerable and capable of showing and feeling legititmate emotions. His facade is dropped when he opens up to Rapunzel and becomes a loving, loyal and protective companion.</p>
